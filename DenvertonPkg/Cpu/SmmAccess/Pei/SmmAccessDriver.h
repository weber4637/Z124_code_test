Routine Description:

  This is the standard EFI driver point that detects
  whether there is an proper chipset in the system
  and if so, installs an SMM Access Protocol.

Arguments:

  ImageHandle  -  Handle for the image of this driver.
  SystemTable  -  Pointer to the EFI System Table.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS      -  Protocol successfully started and installed.
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED  -  Protocol can't be started.

/*++

Routine Description:

  This routine accepts a request to "open" a region of SMRAM.  The
  region could be legacy ABSEG, HSEG, or TSEG near top of physical memory.
  The use of "open" means that the memory is visible from all boot-service
  and SMM agents.

Arguments:

  This             -  Pointer to the SMM Access Interface.
  DescriptorIndex  -  Region of SMRAM to Open.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS            -  The region was successfully opened.
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       -  The region could not be opened because locked by
                            chipset.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  -  The descriptor index was out of bounds.

Routine Description:

  This routine accepts a request to "close" a region of SMRAM.  This is valid for
  compatible SMRAM region.

Arguments:

  This             -  Pointer to the SMM Access Interface.
  DescriptorIndex  -  Region of SMRAM to Close.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS            -  The region was successfully closed.
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       -  The region could not be closed because locked by
                            chipset.

Routine Description:

  This routine accepts a request to "lock" SMRAM.  The
  region could be legacy AB or TSEG near top of physical memory.
  The use of "lock" means that the memory can no longer be opened
  to BS state..

Arguments:

  This             -  Pointer to the SMM Access Interface.
  DescriptorIndex  -  Region of SMRAM to Lock.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS            -  The region was successfully locked.
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       -  The region could not be locked because at least
                            one range is still open.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  -  The descriptor index was out of bounds.

/*++

Routine Description:

  This routine services a user request to discover the SMRAM
  capabilities of this platform.  This will report the possible
  ranges that are possible for SMRAM access, based upon the
  memory controller capabilities.

Arguments:

  This          -  Pointer to the SMRAM Access Interface.
  SmramMapSize  -  Pointer to the variable containing size of the
                   buffer to contain the description information.
  SmramMap      -  Buffer containing the data describing the Smram
                   region descriptors.

Returns:

  EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  -  The user did not provide a sufficient buffer.
  EFI_SUCCESS           -  The user provided a sufficiently-sized buffer.
