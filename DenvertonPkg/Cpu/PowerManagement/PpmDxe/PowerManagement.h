Routine Description:

  Initialize the power management support.
  This function will do boot time configuration:
    Install into SMRAM/SMM
    Detect HW capabilities and SW configuration
    Initialize HW and software state (primarily MSR and ACPI tables)
    Install SMI handlers for runtime interfacess

Arguments:

  ImageHandle   - Pointer to the loaded image protocol for this driver
  SystemTable   - Pointer to the EFI System Table

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS   The driver installed/initialized correctly.
  Driver will ASSERT in debug builds on error.  PPM functionality is considered critical for mobile systems.
