Routine Description:

  Initializes the processor power management library.  This must be called
  prior to any of the library functions being used.

  At this time, we don't properly publish the PPM processor support protocol,
  we simply return it if this library implements the protocol.

  If the processor is not supported, the input will not be modified.

Arguments:
  
  This          Pointer to the PPM support protocol instance

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS         Library was initialized successfully
  EFI_NOT_SUPPORTED   The library does not support the current processor
