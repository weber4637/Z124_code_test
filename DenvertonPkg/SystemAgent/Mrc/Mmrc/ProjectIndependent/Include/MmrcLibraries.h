  This function is the center for the Advanced Training Algos.  Currently there are 5 possible elements to loop on:
  Channel, Rank, Knob, Strobe, and Bit.  The first 5 loops on each of these elements and if they are not shared
  uses that index and goes to the next element.  If they are shared, the loop goes to the next element but will not loop
  to the next element such that only those elements that are independent will be looping on...
    For example, RANK_SHARED, BIT_SHARED   Ch[0->MAX_CHANNELS],Rn[0],Knob[0->MAX_KNOBS], Sl[0->MAX_STROBES],Bit[0]
  At the innermost loop (bit), all permutations of the non-shared [CH][RN][KN][SL][BI] will be hit.
  The system will not do another 5 loops, looping through each of these elements again but this time doing the opposite.
  Namely, hitting all the shared items... the outermost loops use IndChn, IndRnk,.. inner uses ShrChn, ShrRnk, etc...
  So at the innermost loop now, each shared elements of the unique elements can be checked.

  A couple of features can be accomplished by this:
    1.  Composite, the system can check the ranges of the passed in data and collect the worst range of all.
    2.  Composite count, the system can check the counts if not max, set to 0....
    3.  Test Function can be called with/without the compositing passing in the unique Ch/Rn/Kn/Sl/Bi.
  The test function removes the requirement to have many functions performing the same looping as required by this function.

  @param[in]       FullSweep       THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED. If TRUE, sweep the entire range from min to max.
  @param[in] SkipInitialValueProgramming When TRUE, do not program initial low edge starting values or high edge
