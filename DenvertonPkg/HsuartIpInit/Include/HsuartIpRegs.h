Module Name:

  HsuartIpRegs.h

Abstract:

  Driver for Hsuart IP Register definitions.

  Conventions:

  - Prefixes:
    Definitions beginning with "R_" are registers
    Definitions beginning with "B_" are bits within registers
    Definitions beginning with "V_" are meaningful values of bits within the registers
    Definitions beginning with "S_" are register sizes
    Definitions beginning with "N_" are the bit position
  - In general, HSURAT registers are denoted by "_HSUART_" in register names
  - Registers / bits that are different between HSUART generations are denoted by
    "_HSUART_<generation_name>_" in register/bit names. e.g., "_HSURAT_LPT_"
  - Registers / bits that are different between SKUs are denoted by "_<SKU_name>"
    at the end of the register/bit names
  - Registers / bits of new devices introduced in a HSUART generation will be just named
    as "_HSUART_" without <generation_name> inserted.
