/**
  Sends an 32-bit value to a POST card.

  Sends the 32-bit value specified by Value to a POST card, and returns Value.  
  Some implementations of this library function may perform I/O operations 
  directly to a POST card device.  Other implementations may send Value to 
  ReportStatusCode(), and the status code reporting mechanism will eventually 
  display the 32-bit value on the status reporting device.
  
  PostCode() must actively prevent recursion.  If PostCode() is called while 
  processing another any other Post Code Library function, then 
  PostCode() must return Value immediately.

  @param  Value  The 32-bit value to write to the POST card.

  @return The 32-bit value to write to the POST card.
