Routine Description:

  This function checks the memory range in PEI. 

Arguments:

  PeiServices     Pointer to PEI Services.
  This            Pei memory test PPI pointer.
  BeginAddress    Beginning of the memory address to be checked.
  MemoryLength    Bytes of memory range to be checked.
  Operation       Type of memory check operation to be performed.
  ErrorAddress    Return the address of the error memory address.
    
Returns:
  
  EFI_SUCCESS         The operation completed successfully.
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR    Memory test failed. It's not safe to use this range of memory.
